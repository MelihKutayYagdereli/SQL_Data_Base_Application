Simple Database Application for Flower Shopping Site 

Bilkent CS 281 Data base term project

In this project you will be asked to develop a simple database application using Phyton and
SQLite. SQLite is library that implements a self-contained and full-featured SQL database
engine. First of all, to build your application, you should design the schema structure of the
database. The best way to do this is to prepare an Entity/Relationship diagram and then to
translate it into actual tables in SQLite. For this purpose, you will use SQLiteStudio, which is
a cross-platform GUI application for managing SQLite databases. Later, you should populate
your tables for test purposes. The second step will be to design possible queries on your
tables and write them in SQL using SQLite with Phyton programming language. The third
step will be to learn how to design a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python, utilizing
PySimpleGUI, and finally to connect your tables and queries together in a menu system
using these GUIs. For example, you should have screens that allow the user to manipulate
(insert, update and delete tuples) the data in your tables as well as other screens that let the
user to execute some meaningful queries.
